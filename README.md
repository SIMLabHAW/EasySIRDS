EasySIRDS is an quick and easy way to create Single Image Random Dot Stereograms and to test your subjects for 
stereooptic acuity.

To use our programm, you can either use the EasySIRDS.exe to create new SIRDS images to use in your own program, 
you can use the already existing SIRDS Test.rar, which tests stereooptic acuity in 3 different difficulties or you
can use our code to create your own version.

The SIRDS generator uses 1024x1024 bmp maps to create the final SIRDS. An example is given as test_map.bmp.
